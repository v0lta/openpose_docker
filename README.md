## Usage

**You will need a host system with drivers for cuda 10**

(1) clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jutanke/openpose_docker.git
```

(2) build the docker container
```
cd openpose_docker && ./build.sh
```

(3) Usage:
```
./openpose.sh /your/img/input/dir /your/output/dir/keypoints/json
```

The keypoint json files will be located in the output folder.

### Extracting heatmaps and PAFs
If you want to extract the heatmaps and PAFs as well, simply call:
```
./heatmaps.sh /your/img/input/dir /your/output/dir/keypoints/json
```
The keypoints will be organized in the same way as with __openpose.sh__, however, you will find a directory __heatmaps__ as subfolder to the output directory where the heatmaps and pafs are stored as single pngs.
Please read the openpose documentation for a detailed structured definition.

### Visualization

If you just want to visualize your images using Openpose you can use the following script:
```
./visualize.sh /your/img/input/dir
```

### Torso-Normal from depth data.
Edit the path descriptions in ``torso_docker_run.sh`` the first path should refer to the location of this folder the second should link to the location of the data-set.
Within the container cd to ``/home/openpose_docker`` and execute ``orientation_estimation.py``.
